#Data Collection using Google Forms & Leaflet

This is a simple web app that uses Google Forms and Leaflet to allow for participatory mapping using a modern web browser. Check out the [demo](https://aogdp.github.io/gpsform/)

##Instructions

This is heavily modified from aogdp's version above to allow for participatory mapping. 
I didn't even fork it because it's so different.

Basically, in its current form, it gives three markers that respondents can choose from to add to a big map.
