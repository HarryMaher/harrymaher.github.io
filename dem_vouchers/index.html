    <p><h2>Democracy Voucher Data Show Small Donors Support Opposing Campaigns</h2></p>
    <br>
    <iframe src="network.html" width="700px" height="450px" frameborder="1" scrolling="yes" align="center"></iframe>
    <br><br>
    <p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">Many of the Seattleites that contributed money to candidates using the Democracy Voucher program donated to <i>opposing candidates running for the same office</i>. The program provides Seattle residents with four $25 vouchers to donate to candidates running for city offices with the intention of taking power from big corporate donors and returning it to the voters in the form of publicly-funded elections. While it may be mysterious that many program participants are donating these small amounts of money to competing campaigns, the fact that they are doing this reflects the complicated reality of the electorate and provides an argument in support of Ranked Choice Voting.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">As with all direct campaign donation data, democracy voucher data are public and accessible through the City of Seattle&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher">Board of Elections</a> website where they are updated and released regularly throughout the election season. Vouchers received by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission (SEEC) are reviewed to ensure the signature matches the voter&rsquo;s signature and funds are issued to qualifying campaigns. The data displayed in the above graph includes all received vouchers that were assigned to a campaign as of the date marked on the chart. (Note: the vouchers may not have been reviewed, accepted, or redeemed.)</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">The chart shows how many Seattleites have contributed to each campaign using Democracy Vouchers. Each circle represents one campaign, and the circle sizes are directly proportional to the number of vouchers assigned to that campaign. The lines connecting the circles represent the number of shared individual donors each candidate has with every other candidate. When you hover your mouse over one of the circles you can see the number of vouchers, donors, and average number of vouchers per donor that each campaign has been assigned by donors. When you hover your mouse over the lines between the campaigns, a tooltip displays the names of the two campaigns and the number of common donors the two campaigns have shared.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">For example, as of <span style="background:yellow;">March 12, 2,651 donors assigned 7,178</span> vouchers to mayoral candidate Colleen Echohawk, who received the most donations to-date. At the same time, <span style="background:yellow;">757</span> of her donors also donated at least one voucher to her opponent Lorena Gonz&aacute;lez, and, in total, <span style="background:yellow;">1,086 (41%)</span> of her donors allocated vouchers to at least one other mayor candidate. Meanwhile, Gonz&aacute;lez had <span style="background:yellow;">1,703</span> donors, but a majority (<span style="background:yellow;">58%)</span> donated vouchers to at least or other candidate for mayor. Overall, 4,614 donors assigned one or more voucher to a mayoral candidate and <span style="background:yellow;">1,370 (29.6%)</span> donors donated to an opposing campaign.</span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">This behavior may be baffling to some political campaigns. They may think that some voters are confused: why would they effectively cancel out their donation to one politician by donating to another competing politician? But, as a voter I think it makes some sense: in the last Mayoral race, for example, I might have been happy to have candidate A or candidate B win, just as long as candidate C didn&rsquo;t <em>(yet we still ended up with candidate C).</em></span></p>
<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">In most elections, I have a preferred candidate, other candidates who I may also support, and others who I don&rsquo;t. With Democracy Vouchers, we have the power to freely support who we want with small donations. Ranked Choice Voting, a system that allows individuals to vote for multiple candidates based on their order of preference, would give us similar freedom to vote for who we want, in the order we want, without fear of throwing of throwing our vote away. Similar to what the network graph above shows, Ranked Choice Voting allows citizens to voice their complicated and often overlapping preferences for politicians, which makes it &ldquo;the most promising reform to democratize and depolarize our politics,&rdquo; <a href="https://time.com/5718941/ranked-choice-voting/">according to Larry Diamond</a>, former director of Stanford&rsquo;s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:18px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 16px;">Together, Democracy Vouchers and Ranked Choice Voting can dramatically improve local elections nationwide&mdash;they underscore that our officials are selected by a complicated electorate network of individuals who come together to form coalitions consensus that ultimately select their preferred candidates. &nbsp;</span></p>
